## tds-engine
### About
This is just a game engine, so it can't do much on it's own.
See [hunter-game](http://github.com/molecuul/hunter-game) for a demonstration of the engine in an actual game.

### Instructions
`premake4 gmake` generates a makefile.

`make` compiles in debug mode.

`make config=release` compiles in release mode.

`premake4 install` installs the binaries to /usr/lib and /usr/include.
